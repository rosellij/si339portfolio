            <p>The final place I want to visit that I'll talk about on my site here today
                is Miami. Like Venice, Miami is also very high on my list since the face
                of the city is liable to change drastically during my lifetime. I've passed
                through the city once or twice, but never stopped long enough there to
                interact with any part of it. As a food tourist, I can't wait to go to
                Miami! Like Singapore, I've also heard great things about its
                street food scene. Apparently, akin to California, some of the cities'
                greatest culinary minds have recently strived to establish an 
                haute-cuisine for the region, fusing local ingredients and culinary
                traditions with their own incredible talents in the kitchen. Hopefully,
                I'll also be able to spend a little bit of time walking around,
                maybe meet some cool people while I'm there, read a book on the beach
                or something.

            <p>Here's a little blurb about Miami from our friends at <a href = "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Miami">Wikivoyage</a>: Miami is a major city in the south-eastern United States and the second most populous city in Florida. The Miami metropolitan area is the largest in the state with an estimated population of over 6.1 million (2017), which makes it the 7th most populous metro area in the United States.

                Although tourists generally consider Miami Beach to be part of Miami, it is its own municipality. Miami Beach sits on a barrier island east of Miami and Biscayne Bay. It is home to lots of beach resorts, and is one of the most popular spring break party destinations in the world.
            
                Miami has a huge Latin American population, and Spanish is a language often used for day-to-day discourse in many places. However, English is the language of preference, particularly when dealing with businesses and government. The local Latin population is mostly Cuban exiles (who have now become second and third generation locals), with South Americans from various countries gaining ground. There is also a large Haitian community and many signs and public announcements are in English, Spanish and Creole.

                Miami has a rich history as a trend-setting arts center, from the world famous nightclubs of the 1950s to the rich cultural life of today's modern South Beach. Today the entertainment, production and arts communities of Miami Beach are stronger than ever.</p>
