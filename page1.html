                    Yes, it's a really popular place to go, and a bit cliche, but
                    it's no myth that Venice is, in fact, <em>sinking</em>
                    in addition to the threats it faces from this planet's rising
                    sea level. Personally, I just want to see it before I'm no longer
                    able to.<br><br>Regardless of all that, it does seem like a place
                    with no equal, in a similar vain to Singapore, but for different
                    reasons. You get around everywhere by canal and walkways!
                    I just think that's neat, you know? There's also all the
                    wonderful Renaissance architecture, little alleys to get 
                    lost amongst, and there's also gotta be some wonderful food
                    to enjoy, right? I did a little reading and found out that
                    Venetian food is a little different from that of the rest 
                    of Italy, that their whole shtick is using squid ink
                    ("nella seppia") to flavor and color their food. The city's
                    also home to my favorite dessert, Tiramisu, which, opposed
                    to other Italian favorites such as Pasta alla Carbonara,
                    has only been around since the sixties, for a handful of decades.

                <p id = "blurb5" tabindex = 0>Here's a blurb about Venice from our friends at <a href = "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Venice">Wikivoyage</a>: Venice is a sanctuary on a lagoon that is virtually the same as it was 600 years ago, which adds to the fascinating character. Venice has decayed since its heyday and suffers from overtourism, but the romantic charm remains. It is also known as the birthplace of composers Tomaso Albinoni and Antonio Vivaldi. Venice and its lagoon are a UNESCO World Heritage site. It used to be an independent republic, and remains one of Italy's most important cities, with a quarter million inhabitants.</p>
