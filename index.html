                    This particular place interests me because of how multicultural of a place
                    it is. I've never been anywhere in Asia, but I think this could be a
                    good first step into the continent's far east because it probably wouldn't
                    be as jarring for a Westerner as compared to somewhere, for instance,
                    in rural China. I've heard from my Singaporean friends that the street food
                    is also excellent there. Aside from all this, it just seems like a place
                    that's very indicative of our current period in time, seeing immense
                    economic growth in a very short time, a place that's become very glitzy
                    from extremely humble beginnings even as recent as the 60's, like Dubai,
                    and I'm interested to see what life is like in a place like that, to talk
                    with more people from there, and to experience it for myself, at least
                    for a little bit.</p>

                <p id = "blurb2">Here's a blurb about Singapore from our friends at <a href = "https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Singapore">Wikivoyage</a>: Singapore is a city-state in Southeast Asia. Modern Singapore was founded as a British trading colony in 1819, and since independence, it has become one of the world's most prosperous countries and boasts one of the world's busiest ports. Singaporean food is legendary, with bustling hawker centres and 24-hour coffee shops offering affordable food from all parts of Asia. Combining the skyscrapers and subways of an affluent, futuristic and modern city with a medley of different Asian cultures such as the Chinese, Malay and Indian influences and a tropical climate, with tasty food, good shopping and a vibrant nightlife scene, this Garden City makes a great stopover or springboard into the region.

                    The country has a partly deserved reputation for its sterile predictability and neutrality. Nevertheless, the "Switzerland of Asia" is for many a welcome respite from the chaos, dirt and poverty of much of the neighbouring Southeast Asian mainland. If you scratch below the squeaky clean surface and get away from the tourist trail you'll soon find more than meets the eye in one of the few city-states in the world.</p>

<!-- Make a contact form pop up from the footer with an animation? -->

<!-- The three paragraphs can be three cross-screen bands
displayed in block, and each time we pass one a new background image
comes up parallax-style (see W3 schools example, we're basically
gonna copy this) -->

<!-- We can make each of the things in the nine-image
page a flip card, and make em all keyboard accessible? -->
