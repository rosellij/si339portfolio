            <p>These first three places are, of course, only a small sampling of all the
                ones I wish to visit. On this page, I've included a few more places that
                are high on my list but didn't make the cut to get an entire page about
                them. Many of these places are also so high up on my list simply because,
                due to rapidly changing social, political, and environmental factors, they
                may not be what they are today in only a couple decades. Nonetheless,
                they're all places that seem super interesting to me, and I very much
                still want to visit each and every one of them as soon as I'm able.
            </p>
            <p>Regardless of whether or not you feel similarly about any of the places
                on my particular list, I encourage you to think yourself about those
                places that you want to visit, for whatever reason, even if it may be
                out of reach at the moment. Dreams are what keep us going as people,
                and having such a clear one as getting to a physical place can be an
                especially potent one! Do your best to use these dreams simply as goals,
                though, not as an escape from your own life. Do feel strongly about these
                dreams, but not so strongly that they overtake who you are and what you
                are doing right now. Today, do what you are able to, and tomorrow, you
                might just be a step or two closer to reaching that place of yours!.</p>

                                    years, its culture is changing even faster:
                                    the Beijing government is systematically
                                    attempting to replace the Tibetan people
                                    and their traditions with Han Chinese
                                    stand-ins. I hope to get a glimpse of this
                                    mile-high country, its resilient people and
